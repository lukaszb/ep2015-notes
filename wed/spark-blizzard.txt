- nice structured talk
- good speaker
- easy to follow slides
- explains briefly how spark works
- https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html
- example of analyzing 20gb json file (wow auctionhouse data) on 8 machines
- quick demo at the end

Would I recommend watching it: Yep, it doesn't give much insight into
the Spark, though. OTOH, it gives nice overview.

- speaker: very good
- we have a phd here ;-)
- machine learning super quick introduction
  with diagrams explaining supervised/unsupervised clastering
- describes assertions from the numpy.testing package
- mentioned unittest.mock
- shows examples of problems with classification,
  overfitting, underfitting etc.
- lists some numpy/scipy tools to check how
  good is our algo

Summary: not clear examples, lack of continuation
(talk doesn't 'evolve' but rather jumps).

Would I recommend watching it: No, I would rather recommend reading a chapter of "Collective Inteligence" by Toby Segaran instead.

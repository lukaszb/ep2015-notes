- Engaging slides.
- Nice brief summary of ECMA Script 2015 (with examples)
- libs: webpack, eslint, react
- ReactJS code samples
- asyncio introduction, list of related packages
- aiohttp.web code samples

Would I recommend watching it: Yes, but not for tehnical knowledge. It's type of forward-screenshot-repeat talk. One can grab a list of interesting packages/snippets, though.

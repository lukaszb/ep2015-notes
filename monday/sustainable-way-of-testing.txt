Speaker: voice and a way of speaking made me sleepy.

- structure tests into couple of methods (given - when - then)
- parametrize repeating tests (i.e. pytest.mark.parametrize)
- metaclass ... wtf?
- frames ... wait, what? he is still talking about parametryzing
- something about skipping test methods when inheriting
  from another test class...

Reqs:

- parametrized tests
- inherited tests data
- no test repetition
- controlled execution

Would I recommend watching it: Not really. Speaker assumed
that everyone uses test classes and recommended methods
to simplify code. Personally I prefer stateless function
over methods and break DRY rule when writing tests (which
can make them more readable [in cost of more lines]).
